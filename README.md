## Detailed Installation Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

1. Install Node.js:
   - Download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. Install pnpm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   pnpm --version
   ```

3. Install Python:
   - Download from [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Ensure Python is added to PATH during installation
   - Verify installation: `python --version`

4. (Windows Only) Configure UTF-8 Support:
   ```bash
   # Set system-wide UTF-8
   setx PYTHONIOENCODING UTF-8
   # Set current session UTF-8
   set PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8
   # Enable UTF-8 in command prompt
   chcp 65001
   ```

### 2. Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JDJR2024/markdownify-mcp-utf8.git
   cd markdownify-mcp-utf8
   ```

2. Create and activate Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Linux/macOS
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   pnpm install

   # Install Python dependencies (will be handled by setup.sh)
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

### 3. Verification

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

2. Test the installation:
   ```bash
   # Convert a web page
   python convert_utf8.py "https://example.com"

   # Convert a local file
   python convert_utf8.py "path/to/your/file.docx"
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. Converting Web Pages:
   ```bash
   python convert_utf8.py "https://example.com"
   ```
   The converted markdown will be saved as `converted_result.md`

2. Converting Local Files:
   ```bash
   # Convert DOCX
   python convert_utf8.py "document.docx"

   # Convert PDF
   python convert_utf8.py "document.pdf"

   # Convert PowerPoint
   python convert_utf8.py "presentation.pptx"

   # Convert Excel
   python convert_utf8.py "spreadsheet.xlsx"
   ```

3. Converting YouTube Videos:
   ```bash
   python convert_utf8.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
   ```

### Advanced Usage

1. Environment Variables:
   ```bash
   # Set custom UV path
   export UV_PATH="/custom/path/to/uv"

   # Set custom output directory
   export MARKDOWN_OUTPUT_DIR="/custom/output/path"
   ```

2. Batch Processing:
   Create a batch file (e.g., `convert_batch.txt`) with URLs or file paths:
   ```text
   https://example1.com
   https://example2.com
   file1.docx
   file2.pdf
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   while read -r line; do python convert_utf8.py "$line"; done < convert_batch.txt
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. Common Issues:
   - If you see encoding errors, ensure UTF-8 is properly set
   - For permission issues on Windows, run as Administrator
   - For Python path issues, ensure virtual environment is activated

2. Debugging:
   ```bash
   # Enable debug output
   export DEBUG=true
   python convert_utf8.py "your_file.docx"
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line

Convert web page to Markdown:
```bash
python convert_utf8.py "https://example.com"
```

Convert local file:
```bash
python convert_utf8.py "path/to/your/file.docx"
```

### Desktop App Integration

To integrate this server with a desktop app, add the following to your app's server configuration:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "markdownify": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "{ABSOLUTE_PATH}/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "UV_PATH": "/path/to/uv"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Encoding Issues
   - If you encounter character encoding issues, ensure the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable is set to `utf-8`
   - Windows users may need to run `chcp 65001` to enable UTF-8 support

2. Permission Issues
   - Ensure you have sufficient file read/write permissions
   - On Windows, you may need to run as administrator
